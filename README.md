# C and C++ Code Repository

This repository contains all the C and C++ programs I practiced during my 3rd and 4th semesters of Computer Science Engineering. These codes reflect my journey of learning and implementing programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

## Contents

The repository includes:

- **Basic Programs:** Foundational C/C++ programs to understand syntax, loops, and conditional statements.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, and other fundamental algorithms.
- **Problem-Solving:** Programs solving various computational problems and challenges.
- **File Handling:** Examples showcasing file operations in C and C++.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone C_and_C++
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder and open the code files with your preferred IDE or text editor.

## Prerequisites

To run the programs, ensure you have:

- A C/C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, MinGW, or an IDE like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio).
- Basic understanding of C/C++ programming.

## Feedback

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from these programs. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please raise an issue or contribute via pull requests.
